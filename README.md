# Transformer
This is first transformer , description:-
* No ui, no workflow, just the code.
* Predicts the value of Gate/exit sensor (0 if no one crosses the gate, 1 if someone crosses it).
* Time series forecasting.
* Uses synthetically generated sensor data .
* Dataset id generated by modelling population motion in an area.
* The Dataset generated model is also posted on another repo named Population model.
* dataset is a feather file, i compressed it in not a good way so its very large , so it put it in another repo .
* Download that file , Remember to the set the path of that file in Transformer too.


## To Run this thing
* copy this code and paste it on google colab or something.
* Take this synthetically generated dataset(it has 100000 something rows and 108 columns).
* Each column contains value of sensors.
* Each row is 5 second apart , as  remeber.
* You can change the parameters , but for now they are hard coded , you have to read the code to change them.hehe
* You can also generate your own Dataset by using the model in Population model repo.
* Generating new dataset would be a hassle because values are kinda hardcoded.
* Reduce the size of Dataset , you would thank me.
